# Gamemode Visualizer

A distant cousin of "Portal Order" from GDBrowser's Level Analysis tools.

For obvious reasons, this mod will show inaccurate results for memory levels, levels with an end trigger, and levels containing directional changes. This mod does its best to detect these traits, but is far from perfect in doing so. Bug reports related to these issues will be ignored.

Support for non-gamemode portals will come at a later date.
